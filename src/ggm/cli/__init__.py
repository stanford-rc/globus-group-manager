# The ggm.cli module is used to implement CLI commands, which are run on the
# server hosting SGGM.  Everything is accessed through one CLI command,
# `stanford-globus-group-manager`, which is created in this file.  Sub-commands
# are defined in sub-modules, imported, and then added to the top-level
# command.
